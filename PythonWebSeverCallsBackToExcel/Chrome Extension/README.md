The Chrome Extension given in this folder is meant to me loaded as an unpacked extension.  To do this do the following

- Open Chrome
- Navigate to chrome://extensions/
- Click on the 'Load unpacked' button which raises a 'Select the extension directory' dialog box
- In the 'Select the extension directory' dialog box select the folder containing this file and the other extension files
- Verify a new extension called "Job Leads 0.0.x" box has appeared, if so this chrome extension is loaded
- Ensure that the slider switch in the "Job Leads 0.0.x" box is set to the right to ensure it is enabled.

You are advised to familiarise yourself with the controls in the box for the chrome extension, they are
- Details button, displays details and  further configuration options, this is a synonym for Settings
- Remove button, uninstalls the extension
- Reload button (circular arrow), instead of using using the Remove button and re-installing, use this to refresh in case of code changes
- Errors button, only visible when errors have occurred.  Click on this to diagnose Errors and bugs.  Most of these should have been resolved at development time
- Enable/Disable slider, self-explanatory

If the extensions is loaded and enabled then an icon will appear on the toolbar horizontally level with the url address
